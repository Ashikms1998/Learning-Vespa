services:This starts the services block. Vespa expects this wrapper for all config.
the container service — this is where:Your search queries will go,Your document feeding API lives,It opens HTTP port 8080
http - Exposes HTTP server on port 8080 (so you can hit localhost:8080)
Each service (search, document-api, http) maps to a bundle that is vespa has this built in
so declaring "search" Accepts HTTP GET/POST search queries and "document-api" Accepts POST/PUT/DELETE docs (CRUD)
"http" will Listens on port 8080.so with search and document-api you can search and feed via HTTP
the id=content can be any name 
the content node, which is where Vespa will actually:Store your documents (like a DB),Build search indexes,Serve vector and full-text queries,Apply ranking logic,A vector DB,search indexer
redundancy = 1 Store 1 copy of each document
document type="product" .../ the type="product" must match your doc.sd schema name. but if i have two schema then write another same like that document line just below it and type will be that schema name 
and You don’t need multiple 'content' blocks — one content cluster can store multiple schema types.
node hostalias="vespa-container" this means Assign this content node to a machine I've nicknamed vespa-container(It's just a name you can call anything .But you must then define it in hosts.xml)
Just make sure the name 'vespa-container' is consistent between services.xml and hosts.xml 
In Vespa, when you're defining <nodes> under a <content> cluster (which handles document storage), Vespa needs to know how to distribute documents across those nodes.
Each node is given a unique ID, called the distribution-key.This key tells Vespa: Put some share of documents on this node.
since this is configured for running a single-node app for learning.So you only have 1 node in your <content> cluster.
That node gets distribution-key="0" — it’s like saying: This is the first and only node where I’ll store all my data.


NOTE: FOR ADMIN ROUTE USE 19071 - Even though you didn’t explicitly set port 19071 in any file, it is built-in to Vespa’s internal services.
Port 19071 from the container → for Vespa internal admin tools to talk to the config server
